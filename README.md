In this project, I seek to learn about these technologies:

- Spark (Pyspark)
- Docker

And use technologies like SQL (Postgres) and Plotly.

Spark is deployed in 3 docker containers and you can interact with the master through another container that contains pyspark and jupyter-lab and the libraries to analyze data.
